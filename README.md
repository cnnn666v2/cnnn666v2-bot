# Cnnn666v2 - Completely free alternative to popular bots
Cnnn666v2 is made with love to users. You were always paywalled to the features in other bots. Now... you aren't :)

Firstly, it was an private project. More like for fun. Soon after, it started to become something more. At the start it had only few commands but after some time, it got over 100 commands.
It was also closed source. Now it's open source.
You can see how I mess up codes usually.

# Support
If you have any problems, be sure to [join support server](https://discord.gg/mt4hDxQpPg) to report issues.
Also it's developed by 1 guy (me) which slows down updates.
Website is being currently re-worked.

# Features
Well, it might be free and made by very small "team" but it doesn't mean that it's bad.
